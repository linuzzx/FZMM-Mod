A fabric mod that is mainly for editing or creating NBT of items in creative, but it also has a few utilities.

## How to use?
The default key to use the mod is `Z` (can be changed in controls), there are also some client-side commands with `/fzmm`

## Gradient
To be able to create gradients for the texts.

Note: when doing this I didn't know [PlaceHolderAPI](https://github.com/Patbox/FabricPlaceholderAPI), so it is possible that in the future I will improve it using that.

## Item groups

An improved version of the one provided by Minecraft 1.19.3
It includes:

- Access only with creative, **op is not required**
- Armor stand with arms
- Small armor stand
- Small armor stand with arms
- Invisible item frame
- Invisible glow item frame
- Special name tags with the description of use for each one
- Unobtainable paints (1.19+)


![Unobtainable items](images/operator_utilities.png)

### Useful block states

A list of items that I think can be useful or at least curious/fun, these items have a tag called [BlockStateTag](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_states) that modifies their properties when placed.

### Loot chests

All types of loot chest, or in other words: a list of chests which each time you open one for the first time has a different loot and all the chests there have different odds and items.

### Player heads

A list of heads of all connected players.

## Incompatibilities

### Resource packs

* Resource packs that modify how the heads look in the hands as it affects how the Player Statue looks
  Examples:
  - [Corrected Mob Heads](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/corrected-mob-heads)
  - [Shelf+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/shelf)

## Special thanks to:
- [Mineskin](https://mineskin.org) for being able to make Player Statue and Head Generator possible thanks to their API
- [Logstone & Jespertheend](https://statue.jespertheend.com) for creating Player Statue (or at least doing something known)
- [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib) and its contributors for making a fairly complete library
- The past, present and future contributors of FZMM mod, including people who report bugs or give me suggestions 

## Disclaimer

The purpose of this mod is not to hack servers or anything related to exploits or bugs, it is simply a free tool to generate items, I am not responsible for what people do with those tools, nor will they be added features that can't be used creatively without damaging a server or players.
